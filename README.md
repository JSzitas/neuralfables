The goal of neuralfables is to use some very questionable models (MLP,
ELM, Random Kitchen Sinks aka Random Fourier Features aka garbage, Echo
State Networks, and whatever else I come up with) in a decent way, from
within **fable** and **fabletools**.

Note that there are also some shenanigans work various GLMs potentially
being used for the above, in an (hopefully not entirely futile) attempt
to forecast things like intermittent demand which give other models
aneurysms.

If you are reading this and the repo seems dead, it did not work and I
moved on with my life.

## Installation

Currently only the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JSzitas/neuralfables")
```

## Example

Aint nobody got time for dat. :)
